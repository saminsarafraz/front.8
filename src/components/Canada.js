            <p className='compelete'>espite Canada’s great size, it is one of the world’s most sparsely populated countries.
                This fact, coupled with the grandeur of the landscape, has been central to the sense of Canadian national
                identity, as expressed by the Dublin-born writer Anna Brownell Jameson,
                who explored central Ontario in 1837 and remarked exultantly on “the seemingly interminable line of
                trees before you; the boundless wilderness around you; the mysterious depths amid the multitudinous
                foliage, where foot of man hath never penetrated…the solitude in which we proceeded mile after mile,
                no human being, no human dwelling within sight.” Although Canadians are comparatively few in number,
                they have crafted what many observers consider to be a model multicultural society, welcoming immigrant
                populations from every other continent. In addition,
                Canada harbours and exports a wealth of natural
                resources and intellectual capital equaled by few other countries
